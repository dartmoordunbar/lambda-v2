    <h1>Natural capital and biodiversity baseline assessment</h1>
    <p>Natural Capital Research was commissioned by Scottish Water to provide a natural capital and biodiversity audit of Scottish Water landholdings. This report sets out the results of the audit for your site.</p>
    <p>With this assessment, you have a rock-solid baseline , based on the best science. As well as gaining a vital tool to manage grants and comply with regulation, you have the starting point for future enhancements to your natural capital.</p>
    <p>Now you have this baseline, you can regularly measure and report on progress on your enhancement activity, conﬁdent in the accuracy of your data. It can also be used to explore and plan for a range of alternative enhancement options, re-running baselines to see what difference they could make to speciﬁc land areas or the wider land context.</p>
    <p>Our team at Natural Capital Research can lead you through this process, helping you plan towards biodiversity net gain and net zero carbon targeting. We would be delighted to support you further to proﬁt from these new opportunities in land management, and help you explore your own options.</p>
    <p>Thank you for commissioning this baseline assessment from us, and taking this important ﬁrst step towards better environmental business planning. We look forward to helping you further on this journey, and would be happy to discuss further. You can contact us at info@natcapresearch.com at any time.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Natural capital can be simply described as the aspects of nature (e.g. species, habitats, communities, soils
      etc.) that provide key ecosystem services underpinning important public goods or benefits (Figure 1).</p>
    <p>We divide natural capital into three categories; stocks, flows and public goods. A stock is the extent and
      condition of a natural resource – what is on the ground, how much of it there is and of what quality. A flow is
      derived from the stock and provides societal benefits, such as important public goods and services.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Figure 1. Schematic to show examples of the relationship between natural capital assets (stocks), ecosystem
      services (flows) and societal benefits (public goods and services)</p>
    <p>This report will show you what natural assets have been found in your chosen area, where they have been found,
      and in what quantity, to provide information that can be placed in an asset register. The report provides you with
      an estimate of the natural capital stocks of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landcover</li>
      <li>Forest, woodland, tree and hedge composition (height)</li>
      <li>Topographical variation of the land (elevation and slope)</li>
      <li>Water and wetlands</li>
      <li>Soil type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The report also provides you with estimates of the following ecosystem services that these assets provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carbon storage</li>
      <li>Carbon sequestration</li>
      <li>Soil erosion prevention</li>
      <li>Flood risk reduction</li>
      <li>Recreation</li>
      <li>Pollination</li>
      <li>Important biodiversity habitats</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity is part of natural capital. It can be considered as both an asset (stock) and a flow (service) of natural capital and must therefore be considered carefully in natural capital assessments. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms including in genetic, phenotypic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, and among species, biological communities and ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>This report provides you with four individual measures of biodiversity for land-based assets, combined to an overall biodiversity metric. These submetrics are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protected species</li>
      <li>Distinctiveness</li>
      <li>Condition of SSSIs</li>
      <li>Nature connectivity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For water bodies, a biodiversity metric is assigned from three submetrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distinctiveness</li>
      <li>Condition of SSSIs</li>
      <li>Water Framework Directive ecological status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A comparison with the Defra Biodiversity metric 3.0 is also provided, for reference.</p>
    <p>This report details the data used by Natural Capital Research Ltd to calculate these ecosystem services and establishes an asset register. The following sections present our ﬁndings on the stocks and ﬂows relating to your chosen report area. We provide a series of maps and tables to illustrate how the various stocks and ﬂows are distributed, and a summary heatmap to help you understand where in your chosen report area multiple overlapping ecosystem services occur.</p>
    <p>The information below provides a critical evidence base for determining where to protect natural capital and where the maximum beneﬁts from the ecosystem services are being provided. It also serves as an important baseline document showing areas with potential for income when a system of payment of ‘public money for public goods’ is implemented.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter2">Section {{ getsectionnumber('section') }}: Ecosystem service flows</h2>
    <p>Natural capital services, or ecosystem service flows, are the services provided by natural capital assets, for example, woodlands (asset) and carbon sequestration (ecosystem service flow) (see Figure. 1).</p>
    <p>Using the information obtained above relating to the distribution, quantity and quality of natural capital stocks (assets), we have modelled the spatial distribution of important ecosystem services (flows) in your chosen report area that are generated by these assets.</p>

Our estimates for trees and hedges are based on a modelling approach that takes account of canopy height and biophysical data, including vegetation greenness from satellite data and estimations of woodland age and yield class[8]. For other vegetation, we use published literature on the carbon density of UK habitats. The resulting carbon storage maps are produced at 25 m resolution and display carbon density of vegetation in tonnes CO2e per hectare, accounting for both aboveground biomass and belowground living biomass (roots).</p>

    <p>Map {{getmapnumber('new')}} displays areas of land in the chosen report area where the vegetation is important in reducing surface rainfall-runoff and thus reducing the downstream ﬂood risk during a storm event. Our estimations are calculated using a catchment approach, and we model water ﬂows using the semi-distributed hydrological model SWAT [13]. SWAT takes account of soil properties, information on landcover and land management (including crop types), topography (including slope), and meteorological data (data from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) including daily rainfall that is based on two sets of global precipitation, one daily at 0.5° latitude/longitude grid and the other with 5-day mean precipitation at 2.5° latitude / longitude grid, both interpolated with gauge observations/reports from ~30,000 stations). The resulting map displays m3 of avoided daily surface runoff per hectare per year at a 25 m resolution.</p>
