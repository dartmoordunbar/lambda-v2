    <h1>Your Natural Capital Baseline</h1>
    <p>An effective environmental and biodiversity programme must be built on the strongest possible evidence. We are
      delighted to provide you with that.</p>
    <p>With this assessment, you have a rock-solid baseline of your environmental assets, based on the best science. As
      well as gaining a vital tool to manage grants and comply with regulation, you have the starting point for future
      enhancements to your natural capital.</p>
    <p>Now you have this baseline, you can regularly measure and report on progress on your enhancement activity,
      confident in the accuracy of your data. It can also be used to explore and plan for a range of alternative
      enhancement options, re-running baselines to see what difference they could make to specific land areas or the
      wider land context.</p>
    <p>Our team at Natural Capital Research can lead you through this process, helping you plan towards biodiversity net
      gain and net zero carbon targeting. We would be delighted to support you further to profit from these new
      opportunities in land management, and help you explore your own options.</p>
    <p>Thank you for commissioning this baseline assessment from us, and taking this important first step towards better
      environmental business planning. We look forward to helping you further on this journey, and would be happy to
      discuss further. You can contact us at info@natcapresearch.com at any time.</p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Natural Capital Research carried out this baseline assessment as of August 1st 2021 - 18:17, using our unique
      NatCap Map tool. It provides you with a critical evidence base for determining where to protect your natural
      capital and where there may be potential for income.</p>
    <p>Using the highest data standards, the following summary assessment comprehensively maps the type and extent of
      the different natural capital stocks on your land, and provides you with estimates of the ecosystem services they
      provide. With this up-to-date baseline register, you have a starting point for planning future land management,
      natural capital enhancement and improvements and revenue generation.</p>
    {% if report_area < 40 %}
    <p><strong>This report is for a chosen area of less than 40 ha. While the data included in this report are of high quality and fine spatial scales (5-25m resolution), we encourage caution when interpreting the results for small sites as uncertainty around the results is increased at smaller scales.</strong></p>

      optimise your natural capital development strategy.</p>
    <img class="map" src="/tmp/heatmap.jpg" />
    <p>The following pages provide you with a breakdown of the individual underlying factors that make up your baseline
      assessment. Each of the following sections present the full data behind those two summary reports above. Each
      section of the report and each map gives you a full set of proof points and measurements, allowing you to present
      your environmental record, confidently and credibly, to government, stakeholders, markets, investors,
      special-interest groups and others.</p>
    <p>They also provide you with the platform for your next steps on enhancing and improving your natural capital
      assets. If you would like further guidance on this, or more information on this report, we would be very pleased

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Natural capital can be simply described as the aspects of nature (e.g. species, habitats, communities, soils
      etc.) that provide key ecosystem services underpinning important public goods or benefits (Figure 1).</p>
    <p>We divide natural capital into three categories; stocks, flows and public goods. A stock is the extent and
      condition of a natural resource – what is on the ground, how much of it there is and of what quality. A flow is
      derived from the stock and provides societal benefits, such as important public goods and services.</p>
    <div class="imagebox">

    </div>
    <p>Figure 1. Schematic to show examples of the relationship between natural capital assets (stocks), ecosystem
      services (flows) and societal benefits (public goods and services)</p>
    <p>This report will show you what natural assets have been found in your chosen area, where they have been found,
      and in what quantity, to provide information that can be placed in an asset register. The report provides you with
      an estimate of the natural capital stocks of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landcover</li>
      <li>Forest, woodland, tree and hedge composition (height)</li>
      <li>Topographical variation of the land (elevation and slope)</li>
      <li>Water and wetlands</li>
      <li>Soil type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The report also provides you with estimates of the following ecosystem services that these assets provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carbon storage</li>
      <li>Carbon sequestration</li>
      <li>Soil erosion prevention</li>
      <li>Flood risk reduction</li>
      <li>Recreation</li>
      <li>Pollination</li>
      <li>Important biodiversity habitats</li>
      <li>Nature networks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This report details the data used by Natural Capital Research Ltd to calculate these ecosystem services and
      establishes an asset register. The following sections present our findings on the stocks and flows relating to
      your chosen report area[1]. We provide a series of maps and tables to illustrate how the various stocks and flows
      are distributed, and a summary heatmap to help you understand where in your chosen report area multiple
      overlapping ecosystem services occur.</p>
    <p>The information below provides a critical evidence base for determining where to protect natural capital and
      where the maximum benefits from the ecosystem services are being provided. It also serves as an important baseline
      document showing areas with potential for income when a system of payment of ‘public money for public goods’ is
      implemented.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="chapter2">Section {{ getsectionnumber('section') }}: Ecosystem service flows</h2>
    <p>Natural capital services, or ecosystem service flows, are the services provided by natural capital assets, for example, woodlands (asset) and carbon sequestration (ecosystem service flow) (see Figure. 1).</p>
    <p>Using the information obtained above relating to the distribution, quantity and quality of natural capital stocks (assets), we have modelled the spatial distribution of important ecosystem services (flows) in your chosen report area that are generated by these assets.</p>
    <h3>{{ getsectionnumber('subsection') }} Carbon storage</h3>
    <h4>{{ getsectionnumber('subsubsection') }} Carbon stored in trees in forests and woodlands</h4>
    <p>Map {{getmapnumber('new')}} displays the carbon storage of trees in forests and woodlands in the chosen report area. Our estimates are based on a modelling approach that takes account of canopy height and biophysical data, including vegetation greenness from satellite data and estimations of woodland age and yield class. The carbon storage map is produced at 25m resolution and displays carbon density of vegetation in tonnes CO2e per hectare, accounting for both aboveground biomass and belowground living biomass (roots)[7].</p>

    <h4>{{ getsectionnumber('subsubsection') }} Carbon stored in trees and vegetation that lie outside of forests and woodlands</h4>
    <p>Map {{getmapnumber('new')}} displays the estimated carbon that is stored by vegetation in hedgerows, parkland and single trees that lie outside of the forests and woodland areas in your chosen report area. Our estimates for trees and hedges are based on a modelling approach that takes account of canopy height and biophysical data, including vegetation greenness from satellite data and estimations of woodland age and yield class[8]. For other vegetation, we use published literature on the carbon density of UK habitats. The resulting carbon storage maps are produced at 25 m resolution and display carbon density of vegetation in tonnes CO2e per hectare, accounting for both aboveground biomass and belowground living biomass (roots).</p>

    <p>Map {{getmapnumber('new')}} displays areas of land in the chosen report area where the vegetation is important in reducing surface rainfall-runoff and thus reducing the downstream flood risk during a storm event. Our estimations are calculated using a catchment approach, and we model water flows using the semi-distributed hydrological model SWAT [13]. SWAT takes account of soil properties, information on landcover and land management (including crop types), topography (including slope), and meteorological data (including rainfall). The resulting map displays m3 of avoided daily surface runoff per hectare per year at a 25 m resolution.</p>
