    <h1>Your natural capital baseline</h1>
    <p>An effective environmental and biodiversity programme must be built on the strongest possible evidence. We are
      delighted to provide you with that.</p>
    <p>With this assessment, you have a rock-solid baseline of your environmental assets, based on the best science. As
      well as gaining a vital tool to manage grants and comply with regulation, you have the starting point for future
      enhancements to your natural capital.</p>
    <p>Now you have this baseline, you can regularly measure and report on progress on your enhancement activity,
      confident in the accuracy of your data. It can also be used to explore and plan for a range of alternative
      enhancement options, re-running baselines to see what difference they could make to specific land areas or the
      wider land context.</p>
    <p>Our team at Natural Capital Research can lead you through this process, helping you plan towards biodiversity net
      gain and net zero carbon targeting. We would be delighted to support you further to profit from these new
      opportunities in land management, and help you explore your own options.</p>
    <p>Thank you for commissioning this baseline assessment from us, and taking this important first step towards better
      environmental business planning. We look forward to helping you further on this journey, and would be happy to
      discuss further. You can contact us at info@natcapresearch.com at any time.</p>
